# PersonalDictionary
Personal Dictionary comes from a idea of keeping track of all the newly learned words.<br>
One learns a new word inorder to increase his communication but it would be more useful if he could store them in a place.<br>
This small project allows to add a new word, search for a word and update existing word.<br>
